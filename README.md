### This is a project of SF Civic Tech [https://www.sfcivictech.org/](https://www.sfcivictech.org/)

# Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and FastAPI as the API backend. It also uses PostgreSQL as the database.

# Getting Started

You can work on this app entirely [locally](#local-development), entirely [using Docker](#development-with-docker), or--if you prefer to focus on front end or back end--a [combination of the two](#hybrid-development).

# Setting Up and Using Environments
## Configuration of environment variables for all environments

We use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive environment variables. To be able to run the app with all features enabled, users will need **write** access to the repository to manually trigger the `Generate .env File` workflow, which creates and uploads an **encrypted** `.env` file as an artifact.

### Contributors working from forks
- If you are contributing from a fork, you do not need to follow the workflow below for core contributors.
- The CI pipeline for forked PRs will automatically use the provided `.env.example`.
- If you don't have `.env`, `.env.example` will be automatically used instead. This allows you to run the app, but with limited functionality (since the real secrets are not included).

### Core contributors
Before starting work on the project, make sure to:

1. Get **write** access to the repository.  Accept invitation after you have been invited.
2. Get the **decryption passphrase** from other devs or in the Slack Engineering channel.
3. Navigate to workflow [on the repository's Actions page](https://github.com/sfbrigade/datasci-earthquake/actions)
4. Click on `Generate .env File` workflow
5. Trigger the workflow with the `Run workflow` button.
6. Click on the job to navigate to the workflow run page.
7. Download the artifact at the bottom of the page and unzip.
8. Decrypt the env file using OpenSSL. In the folder with the artifact, run `openssl aes-256-cbc -d -salt -pbkdf2 -k <YOUR_PASSPHRASE> -in .env.enc -out env` in the terminal. This creates a decrypted file named `env`.
9. Place the decrypted file in the root folder of the project and rename it to `.env`.

The file is organized into four main sections:

- **Postgres Environment Variables**. This section contains the credentials to connect to the PostgreSQL database, such as the username, password, and the name of the database.
- **Backend Environment Variables**. These variables are used by the backend (i.e., FastAPI) to configure its behavior and to connect to the database and the frontend application.
- **Frontend Environment Variables**. This section contains the base URL for API calls to the backend, `NODE_ENV` variable that determines in which environment the Node.js application is running, and the token needed to access Mapbox APIs.
- **Monitoring and Analytics Variables**. This section contains variables for Sentry and Posthog. 

#### ⚠️ If you add a new variable to the Settings class in the backend, you must also add a dummy value for it in .env.example. Otherwise, PRs from forks will fail, since the CI depends on .env.example when secrets are unavailable.`

---


## Development with Docker

This project uses Docker and Docker Compose to run the application, which includes the frontend, backend, and postgres database.  

### Changing code
Docker is configured so that any changes you make should trigger re-compiling by the appropriate service.  If the change is not taking, you may need to restart the server, but you do not have to rebuild everything.  

### Changing configuration files
This includes `pyproject.toml` and `.env`, and `package.json`.  You will need to restart the individual server, but should not have to rebuild everything.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker Compose is installed (usually included with Docker Desktop).

### Starting the application

1. **Build images if not yet created**: From the project root directory (where the docker-compose.yml file is located), run:
   `docker compose build`

1. **Run Docker Compose**: From the project root directory (where the docker-compose.yml file is located), run:
   `docker compose up`

   or

   `docker compose up -d`

   This will:

- Start all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file (e.g., frontend, backend, database)

2. **Start Postgres**

3.  **Access the Application**:
    - The app is running at http://localhost:3000. Note that this may conflict with your local dev server. If so, one will be running on port 3000 and the other on port 3001.
    - The API is accessible at http://localhost:8000.
    - The Postgres instance with PostGIS extension is accessible at http://localhost:5432.
    - To interact with a running container, use `docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]`
      - To run a database query, run `docker exec -it my_postgis_db psql -U postgres -d qsdatabase`
      - To execute a python script, run `docker exec -it datasci-earthquake-backend-1 python <path/to/script>`

    **Note:** If you modify the `Dockerfile` or other build contexts (e.g., `.env`, `package.json`), you should run `docker compose up -d --build` to rebuild the images and apply the changes! You do not need to restart `npm run fast-api dev` when doing so.

### Shutting Down the Application

To stop and shut down the application:

1.  **Stop Docker Compose**: Type `docker compose stop`.

2.  **Bring Down the Containers**: If you want to stop and remove the containers completely, run:
    `docker compose down`
    This will:
    - Stop all services.
    - Remove the containers, but it will **not** delete volumes (so the database data will persist).

    **Note:** If you want to start with a clean slate and remove all data inside the containers, run `docker compose down -v`.

### Rebuilding individual servers
Replace <image name> with `datasci-earthquake-frontend`, `datasci-earthquake-backend`, `datasci-earthquake-db` or `datasci-earthquake-db_test`:

`docker compose build <service_name>`

### Starting/stopping individual servers
Replace <service name> with frontend, backend, db, or db_test:

`docker compose up -d <service_name>`
`docker compose stop <service_name>`

### Troubleshooting

1. You can find the list of running containers (their ids, names, status and ports) by running `docker ps -a`.
2. If a container failed, start troublshooting by inspecting logs with `docker logs <container-id>`.
3. Containers fail when their build contexts were modified but the containers weren't rebuilt. If logs show that some dependencies are missing, this can be likely solved by rebuilding the containers.
4. Many problems are caused by disk usage issues. Run `docker system df` to show disk usage. Use pruning commands such as `docker system prune`to clean up unused resources.
5. `Error response from daemon: network not found` occurs when Docker tries to use a network that has already been deleted or is dangling (not associated with any container). Prune unused networks to resolve this issue: `docker network prune -f`. If this doesn't help, run `docker system prune`.

### Running unit tests with Docker

#### Backend

1. First update code and/or rebuild any containers as necessary. Otherwise you may get false results.
2. Run the containers (`docker compose up -d)`
3. Run pytest to test the docker container: `docker exec -it datasci-earthquake-backend-1 pytest backend` or `docker compose exec backend pytest backend`
4. To get code coverage, run `docker exec -w /backend datasci-earthquake-backend-1 pytest --cov=backend`

## Local development
Docker development is recommended as the configuration is more guaranteed.

### Prerequisites

**PostgreSQL**: 
1. [Install](https://adoptium.net/) Java 1.8 or later if your PostgreSQL installer requires it (e.g., the EDB installer).
2. [Install](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) PostgreSQL locally with the PostGIS extension, select the PostGIS extension when prompted by the installer.
3. If PostgreSQL was already installed, add the PostGIS extension if not already included

### Starting the Application

1. Set up a python environment
```bash
python3.11 -m venv backend/venv
```

2. Activate the python environment (NOTE: `npm run dev` will install the dependencies)
```bash
source backend/venv/bin/activate
```

3. Set nvm version
```bash
nvm use 18
```

4. Install the front end dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastAPI server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).

### Troubleshooting

Please refer to [Troubleshooting front end](#troubleshooting-front-end).

---

## Hybrid development

If you will be working exclusively on the front end or back end, you can run the Docker containers for the part of the stack you won't be doing development on, and then run the rest of the stack locally. A handful of NPM scripts have been provided to make this a bit easier (`npm run dev-*` and `npm run docker-*`, described below).

### Accessing the application and API servers

After going through the steps below for either front end-focused or back end-focused development, you should be able to access the servers at the following URLs:

- The app is running at http://localhost:3000, which you can open in your browser.
- The API is accessible at http://localhost:8000.

### Front end-focused development

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker Compose is installed (usually included with Docker Desktop).

#### Starting the app

For front end-focused development, first run `npm install`, and then you can run `npm run dev-front`, which will:

- install dependencies and start up your Next.js development server locally
- build and restart your backend (and database) Docker containers

If you need to rebuild the containers, run `npm run docker-back`.

#### Working with Chakra UI

For UI components, styling, and theming, most initial setup is done via Chakra UI v3 within `theme.ts`. Docs are located at https://chakra-ui.com/. For default theme values, which are automatically used by Chakra along with the overrides in `theme.ts`, you can refer to https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/tree/main/packages/react/src/theme (note that `sizing` is a **superset** of `spacing`).

#### Troubleshooting front end

##### ⚠️ Please do NOT delete `package-lock.json`

The `package-lock.json` file plays a crucial role in ensuring that the exact versions of dependencies installed in `node_modules` remain consistent across different environments.

Deleting this file can lead to unintended side effects, especially when both `package-lock.json` and the `node_modules` folder are removed and then `npm install` is run. In such cases, a new `package-lock.json` will be generated based solely on `package.json`, which might diverge significantly from the committed lock file and cause unexpected behavior or bugs.

In the event of merge conflicts involving `package-lock.json`, please **do not manually fix or delete the file**. Instead, run `npm install` to automatically resolve and repair the lock file.

If you are experimenting locally, you may delete `package-lock.json`, but **make sure not to commit the regenerated file to the repository** to avoid affecting others.

Because `package-lock.json` changes are sometimes overlooked during code reviews, it’s important to pay close attention and avoid accidentally committing problematic versions.

If you face any issues related to `package-lock.json`, please raise them with the team before making changes.

Thank you for helping keep the project stable!

##### Suspense boundary missing around `useSearchParams()`, causing entire page to deopt into client-side rendering (CSR)

You may run into the following NextJS error when you run `npm run build`[^1]:

```shell
useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/<PAGE_NAME>". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/missing-suspense-with-csr-bailout
```

> [!INFORMATION] > `<PAGE_NAME>` refers to a `page.tsx` file in the app, either the root page at `app/page.tsx` or a non-root page at, for example, `app/<PAGE_NAME>/page.tsx`.

The fix is to wrap any component that references `useSearchParams()` with React's `<Suspense>`. Read further to understand why.

This error message can be highly misleading because it refers directly to `<PAGE_NAME>` even though it's more likely that its `page.tsx` file contains zero usages of `useSearchParams()`[^2]. This can make debugging difficult.

The error doesn't make a distinction between `<PAGE_NAME>` and its descendant components, unfortunately, which is what causes the confusion. If you can't find usages of `useSearchParams()` directly in `page.tsx`, then you can search for usages in its descendant components instead. Once you find a component with a usage, you can [fix the error](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/missing-suspense-with-csr-bailout) by wrapping any references to the component with `<Suspense>` (and, ideally, providing a fallback) and `npm run build` again. More details can be found at https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/missing-suspense-with-csr-bailout.

There may be some instances where a usage of `useSearchParams()` does not appear even in a descendant component, but rather in, say, a provider. And, anecdotally, there may be other hooks that trigger a similar error message. Extensive discussion about several variants of this error message and workarounds can be found in this Github Issue: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/61654.

[^1]: Note that this error message may be accompanied by the more generic error:

```shell
Error occurred prerendering page "/<PAGE_NAME>". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/prerender-error"
```

[^2]: Since most pages will be Server Components, which do not contain a `"use client"` directive, `useSearchParams()` usages are not even allowed

##### MapBox polygon rendering

If there are issues with layers showing data, you can add the following snippet in `map.tsx` under the other `addLayer()` calls to see outlines of each MultiPolygon:

```js
map.addLayer({
  id: "tsunamiLayerOutline",
  source: "tsunami",
  type: "line",
  paint: {
    "line-color": "rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)",
    "line-width": 4,
  },
});
```

### Back end-focused development (WIP)

> [!CAUTION]
> This section is currently undergoing review and correction. Do not use this method. Instead, please [develop using Docker](#development-with-docker).

#### ~~Prerequisites~~

- ~~**Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).~~
- ~~**Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker Compose is installed (usually included with Docker Desktop).~~
- ~~**PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed to run the database locally (instead of in a Docker container).~~

#### ~~Starting the app~~

~~For back end-focused development, you can run `npm run dev-back`, which will:~~

- ~~install dependencies and start up your FastAPI server locally~~
- ~~build and restart your frontend Docker containers~~

~~If you need to rebuild the container, run `npm run docker-front`.~~

~~NOTE: You will need to run PostgreSQL locally or in a Docker container as well.~~

# Development Guidelines

## Formatting with a Pre-Commit Hook

This repository uses `Black` for Python and `ESLint` for JS/TS to enforce code style standards. We also use `MyPy` to perform static type checking on Python code. The pre-commit hook runs the formatters automatically before each commit, helping maintain code consistency across the project. It works for _only_ the staged files. If you have edited unstaged files in your repository and want to make them comply with the CI pipeline, then run `black .` `mypy .` for Python code and `npm run lint .` for Javascript code.

### Prerequisites

- If you haven't already, install pre-commit:
  `pip install pre-commit`
- Run the following command to install the pre-commit hooks defined in the configuration file `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
  `pre-commit install`
  This command sets up pre-commit to automatically run ESLint, Black, and MyPy before each commit.

### Usage

- **Running Black Automatically**: After setup, every time you attempt to commit code, Black will check the staged files and apply formatting if necessary. If files are reformatted, the commit will be stopped, and you’ll need to review the changes before committing again.
- **Bypassing the Hook**: If you want to skip the pre-commit hook for a specific commit, use the --no-verify flag with your commit command:
  `git commit -m "your commit message" --no-verify`.

  **Note**: The `--no-verify` flag is helpful in cases where you need to make a quick commit without running the pre-commit checks, but it should be used sparingly to maintain code quality. CI pipeline will fail during the `pull request` action if the code is not formatted.

- **Running Pre-commit on All Files**: If you want to format all files in the repository, use:
  `pre-commit run --all-files`

---

## Migrating the Database

If you have changed the models in backend/api/models, then you must migrate the database from its current models to the new ones with the following two commands:

`docker exec -it BACKEND_CONTAINER_NAME bash -c "cd backend && alembic revision --autogenerate -m 'MIGRATION NAME'"`

and

`docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME bash -c "cd backend && alembic upgrade head"`

where `BACKEND_CONTAINER_NAME` may change with the project and perhaps its deployment but, for local Docker development is `datasci-earthquake-backend-1` and `MIGRATION NAME` is your choice and should describe the migration.

The former command generates a migration script in `backend/alembic/versions`, and the second command runs it.

---

## Git Workflow

### General

Developers should only branch from `develop`, pull updates to `develop`, and ensure their work is merged into `develop` via Pull Requests. `main` is the safe production branch.

### Pull Requests

When opening a pull request, please:

- aim the pull request at the `develop` branch rather than `main`
- add reviewers
- use draft/WIP if it turns out to be not ready for review
- link the relevant issue so it is automatically closed when the PR is merged

Ideally, we maintain a readable, clean, and linear commit history. To that end, when merging a pull request, please use `Squash and Merge`¹.

> ¹ you can optionally use `Rebase and Merge` _if and only if_ the following conditions are met on your branch:
>
> - commits are atomic, no WIP
> - there is more than one commit
> - ideally, there are no more than 3 commits
> - commit messages are useful
>
> NOTE: An interactive rebase (e.g., `git rebase -i`) can help you rewrite your branch's _local_ history to meet the criteria above

### Creating Issues

New issues can be created in the Issues tab using the `New issue` button.

When creating an issue, please:

- use the correct template(default, feature request, bug, etc...)
- add the `SafeHome Project` as a project to the issue. If this is your first issue you will likely need to request access to be added to the project and have write access. You can ask in Slack.
- add the relevant label(front end, back end, etc...) so it can easily be filtered by team
